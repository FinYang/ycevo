\title{Simulates fake data used in the vignette}
\usage{
simulate_data(max_qDate = 12, periods = 36, bond_multiplier = 2,
  coupon_frequency = 3, coupon_rates = 1:5, sdev = 0.1,
  arma_terms = list(ar = 0.1, ma = 0), yield = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{max_qDate}{An integer giving the number of quotation dates to use in the data. Defaults to 12.}

\item{periods}{An integer giving the maximum number of time to maturity periods the yield curve is estimated for each quotation date. Defaults to 36}

\item{bond_multiplier}{An integer giving the number of bonds to simulate for each day in the data.
Total bonds equals multiplier * (periods + max_qdate). Defaults to 2}

\item{coupon_frequency}{Integer, frequency of coupon payments. Defaults to 3}

\item{coupon_rates}{Vector, allowed coupon rates in percentage, each bond will have a coupon randomly drawn from this vector. Defaults to c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)}

\item{sdev}{Standard deviation of the price errors, which is scaled by the square root of time to maturity so long term bonds have a larger error.
Defaults to 0.1}

\item{arma_terms}{List of ar and ma parameters passed to arima.sim to add error dependency. Defaults to list(ar= 0.1, ma = 0)}

\item{yield}{Matrix of yield curves at different time to maturities from generate_yield().
If NULL, a yield matrix is created from the default values of generate_yield() with the values of max_qDate and periods input to simulate_data()}
}
\value{
Data frame with the following columns. See also \code{Details}.
\describe{
   \item{qdate}{The quotation date, as an integer}
   \item{crspid}{Factor that uniquely identifies the bond}
   \item{mid.price}{The quoted price of the bond on that day}
   \item{tupq}{Time until a given payment, given in days}
   \item{pdint}{Numeric value of payment}
   \item{tumat}{Time until maturity, in days (equal to tupq for zero coupon bonds)}
   \item{accint}{The accumulated interest on payments}
}
}

\details{
The discount rate for each time to maturity and quotation date is calculated as
\deqn{Discount_{i, t} = \exp(-\tau_i * Yield_t)}
After getting the discount rate for each quotation date and time to maturity, bonds are simulated and priced, where the price of Bond \eqn{j} on quotatoin date \eqn{t} is given by
\deqn{Price_{t, j} = \sum_i payment_i Discount_{i, t}}
A small error is added to each price. The resulting data may be input into estimate_yield with suitable grid values. This is shown in the vignette
